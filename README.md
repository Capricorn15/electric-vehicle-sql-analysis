## Electric Vehicle SQL Analysis
![](images/ev_icon.png)

### Project Overview 
This project explores electric vehicle (EV) dataset using SQL to gain insights into electric vehicle distribution, pricing, and characteristics across various dimensions like city, county, and state.

By leveraging SQL queries on a structured EV dataset, the project simulates real-world data analytics work often performed in mobility, transportation, or e-commerce companies interested in sustainable vehicle markets.

## Objectives
### EV Distribution:
- List the total number of electric vehicles for each state and each county.
- Determine all electric vehicles located in the city of Seattle.

### MSRP Comparison:
- Find all electric vehicles with a Base MSRP greater than the average MSRP of all vehicles in the electric vehicle population.

### Plug-in Hybrid Analysis:
- List all Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV) from King County with an electric range greater than 50 miles.

### High-Concentration Cities:
- Count the number of electric vehicles in each city, but only include cities with more than 100 vehicles.

### Long-Range Vehicles by County:
- List the Make and Model of electric vehicles located in counties where the average electric range exceeds 150 miles.

### Vehicle Categorization according to Base MSRP
- Categorize vehicles as either "Affordable" (Base MSRP ‚â§ $40,000) or "Expensive" (Base MSRP > $40,000) and find the total number of vehicles in each category.

### Electric Range Ranking:
- Display the Make, Model, and Electric Range of each vehicle along with its rank based on the electric range within its county (highest range first).

### Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Analysis with CTEs:
- Calculate the total number of electric vehicles and CAFV-eligible vehicles for each state and
compute the percentage of CAFV-eligible vehicles for each state.

**Vehicle Categorization according to Base MSRP**

Categorize vehicles as either "Affordable" (Base MSRP ‚â§ $40,000) or "Expensive" (Base MSRP > $40,000) and find the total number of vehicles in each category.
```
select
	case 
		when base_msr <= 40000 then 'Affordable' 
		when base_msr > 40000 then 'Expensive'
		else 'Not Available'
	end as ev_cost_category,
